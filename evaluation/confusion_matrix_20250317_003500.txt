This is a placeholder for the confusion matrix image.
In a real implementation, this would be a PNG file showing the confusion matrix visualization.

The confusion matrix would show:
- True Positives: 450
- False Positives: 35
- True Negatives: 465
- False Negatives: 50

The visualization would use a heatmap with color intensity representing the number of predictions in each category.
