Sentiment Analysis Application
Project Overview
This application provides sentiment analysis for product reviews and user feedback using a fine-tuned BERT model. It features a modern React frontend and a FastAPI backend with user authentication, allowing users to analyze sentiment in text and store results in a PostgreSQL database.

Technologies Used

Frontend
React: Building the user interface with functional components
Tailwind CSS: Styling the application with a utility-first approach
Vite: Fast development and optimized production builds
TypeScript: Type-safe JavaScript for better developer experience
Context API: Managing application state for authentication

Backend
FastAPI: High-performance Python web framework for building APIs
SQLAlchemy: ORM for database interactions
PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing user data and analysis results
JWT Authentication: Secure user authentication with JSON Web Tokens
Pydantic: Data validation and settings management

Machine Learning
Hugging Face Transformers: Framework for working with pre-trained models
PyTorch: Deep learning framework for model training and inference
DistilBERT: Lightweight BERT model used as the base for fine-tuning
Scikit-learn: Evaluation metrics and data processing
Fine-Tuned Model Development

Dataset
The model was fine-tuned on a curated dataset of product reviews from e-commerce platforms, containing:
5M+ labeled reviews balanced between positive and negative sentiment
Diverse product categories to ensure generalizability
Various text lengths and writing styles to improve robustness

Fine-Tuning Process
Data Preprocessing:
Text cleaning and normalization
Tokenization using the DistilBERT tokenizer
Train/validation/test split (80/10/10)

Model Training:
Base model: DistilBERT (distilbert-base-uncased)
Training parameters:
Learning rate: 2e-5
Batch size: 16
Epochs: 4
Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay

Early stopping based on validation loss
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: 92.3%
F1 Score: 0.918
Precision: 0.905
Recall: 0.932
ROC-AUC: 0.957
